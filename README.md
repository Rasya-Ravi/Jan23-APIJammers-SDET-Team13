When using REST Assured to test an API, you can:

Perform HTTP requests (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Validate the status code, headers, and body of the response
Extract values from the response and use them in subsequent requests
Specify and validate the structure of the JSON or XML response
Use test data from external sources, such as Excel or CSV files
